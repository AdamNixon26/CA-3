Project Description:
The purpose of the class assignment 3 is to:
1. Make a repository in github
2. Create a branch and then commit after some changes in a file
3. Write a readme.md file describing all changes you made
4. Take the screenshots of all steps you did and submit as a file

Steps we took:
1. We made a repository named CA-3.
2. We created a new branch called First Branch.
3. After creating a branch, we made a file called PracticeFile.  PracticeFile is just a text file to demonstrate an easy file being committed.
4. We committed this file to the first branch.
5. We created this readme.md file describes all of the actions that we took.
6. We included many screenshots in a PDF that will later be sent to the professor.
